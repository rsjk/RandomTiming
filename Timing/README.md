# Random Number Generator Timing
We were tasked to create a program that requests a random number from all four of our IP addresses and record the time it takes. In our [Random Number GCP Project](https://github.com/Andy-Vu-Viz/RandomNumberGen-Servlets), we created a [python script](https://github.com/Andy-Vu-Viz/RandomNumberGen-Servlets/blob/master/testscript.py) to test the uniqueness of our random number generators. The script requests 1000 numbers 10 times, and each time it checks that at least 750 are unique. To test the timing of our generators, we needed to modify the script to account for time. Our first implementation is the following:
