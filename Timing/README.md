# Random Number Generator Timing
We were tasked to create a program that requests a random number from all four of our IP addresses and record the time it takes. The script timing.py can be found in our [repository](https://github.com/rsjk/RandomTiming/blob/master/Timing). In our [Random Number GCP Project](https://github.com/Andy-Vu-Viz/RandomNumberGen-Servlets), we created a python script to test the uniqueness of our random number generators. The script requests 1000 numbers 10 times, and each time it checks that at least 750 are unique. To test the timing of our generators, we decided needed to modify the script to record time rather than test uniqueness.

## Implementation
### Original Script
This is the original script we made to test the uniqueness of the random numbers generated by our random number generators. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Andy-Vu-Viz/RandomNumberGen-Servlets/blob/master/testscript.py).

### First Implementation

The loops from the original script were removed, and code was added to record the time before and after pinging a server. 

### Final Implementation

Now the script pings a server a ping_amount of times and averages the times. Results are printed to the command line and written to a file "timing_test_log.txt". The script takes a file with the IPs/URLs separated by new lines as a program argument. To run the script from the command line, execute the command "python3 timing.py [name of file]". A file with our random number generator IPs/URLs called urls.txt is available to test in the [repository](https://github.com/rsjk/RandomTiming/blob/master/Timing/timing.py).

## Requirements
The following are required to run timing.py:
* Python 3
* beautifulsoup4
* urllib3
