# Random Number Generator Timing
We were tasked to create a program that requests a random number from all four of our IP addresses and record the time it takes. In our [Random Number GCP Project](https://github.com/Andy-Vu-Viz/RandomNumberGen-Servlets), we created a [python script](https://github.com/Andy-Vu-Viz/RandomNumberGen-Servlets/blob/master/testscript.py) to test the uniqueness of our random number generators. We decided to modfiy the script to record times to solve this task.
